This repository contains a *bash* *script* named **cars.sh** that will **help** a user **maintain an _inventory_** of old cars. A file is included to have cars references to pass as well. 
 
The user will be presented with a menu of **three _options_**:

1. Add a car.
..1. The user can add the **year**,**make** and **model**.
2. Print the complete list of cars added to a *specific* file.
..2. Returns **all the _values_** added previous separated by a **semicolon**.
3. Exit the program
..3. Will print *Goodbye*.
